# 3DKnapSack
This program covers the dynamic approach of resolving the 3D KnapSack problem.

# The knapsack problem

The knapsack problem or rucksack problem is a problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, 
each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight 
is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem 
faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size knapsack and must fill it with the most valuable items. 

# The 3dimensional Knapsack Problem
It have the same aspect but the only difference is that instead of one limit condition (weight) there are two which are the weight and volume.
